Final project 3DigMod

Lots of advanced technology for classification, but we will use voxel based classification.

Voxelization  Try different sizes to see, for instance 80 cm, 50 cm, 45, 30 etc. HC: Don’t use voxel size larger than 1 meter
Classify at least 3 classes  Trees, terrain and buildings (If you can, distinguish between water/road and terrain if you can (heavy computational effort)).
Select 10-20 buildings, 10-20 pieces of terrain and 30 trees, and calculate features based on these (You can calculate the parameters you are gonna use for the classification by selecting features in cloudcompare).
Deadline 15th of November
